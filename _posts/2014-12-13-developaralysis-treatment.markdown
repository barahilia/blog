Some time ago I read an article
[You Too May Be A Victim Of Developaralysis](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/18/you-too-may-be-a-victim-of-developaralysis/).
The text caused me to think about some usual and established things in a new
light. With the evidence of beyond ten thousands likes and tweets, many others
might have shared my impression. After some consideration I decided that no,
I'm not a victim. I feel good with a wealth of existing languages, libraries,
frameworks and systems. I do pursue new ideas and techniques but I'm not harmed
by incompetence in all of them or even the best of them.

Probably, if you are a victim, there's a treatment for developaralysis. As with
most modern undertakings, let's start with Wikipedia:

> People with the flu are advised to get plenty of rest, drink plenty of
> liquids, avoid using alcohol and tobacco and, if necessary, take medications
> such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve the fever and muscle aches
> associated with the flu.

-- from <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza#Treatment>.

Humor aside. With profession, nothing comes as easy as cure to flu. And if all
you want is to take a rest and paracetamol, then better forget about software.
The real treatment is really simple to describe, but very difficult to apply. It
is:

* learn in depth rather than in breadth
* respect good enough solutions

Take a developer experienced with Java that by bad chance must start working in
C\#. Oh, crap! He is used to write `System.out.println("hi")` but now he learns
`Console.WriteLine("hi")`. And the old good looping `for (String s : arr)`
becomes unclear `foreach (var s in arr)`. And he even didn't really start to
harness standard libraries. And yes, good programmers write tests first so we
should go and learn `nUnit` after nice and simple `jUnit` that he is accustomed
to. Dummy `Assert.AreEqual(1+2, 3)` instead of normal and clear
`assertEquals("1+2=3", 1+2, 3)`.

By now you might be laughing to yourself, or calling this rubbish. A good time
to get to the point. Yes, I brought those examples to show, that essentially,
both C\# and Java are not so intrinsically different. They are two languages,
both in their own rights, with mostly not intersecting communities. But still
those coming from Java background will become effective in C\# way sooner than
those coming from no background at all. Or will they?

Alice - sorry for bringing security names here - is a good learner. When she
first met unit tests in her life, she was astonished, and started learning about
and experimenting with them. And she quickly got acquainted with a couple of
well known players in that field: suites, tests, asserts. Probably later she
came to "system under test", starting up and tearing down procedures. Bob is
quite different. He is a renowned sprinter, being the first to accomplish most
tasks. He quickly and efficiently searches the Internet, copies and adapts
relevant code parts, uses libraries and finds well-hidden functions that boost
his productivity. He don't stop to contemplate over how things are done
internally, what is the theory. He looks at examples and mimics commands for
suites, tests and asserts and when the need arises, he comes to start up and
tear down things. Everything works, tests are in place - let's move on.

Both Alice and Bob now should start again with a new language or a new unit test
library. How they perceive the change? Bob continues on the same pace with old
proven techniques. Look up in Internet, copy from documentation. He feels sorry
for all time spent previously and blames his bad luck on the change in course.
To Alice a miracle happens. After short time making herself accustomed to new
code samples she knows how to continue. And that she does at almost the same
pace as it was before. Yes, she still stops from time to time to debug a strange
mystery. And behavior is not exactly the same. But... all the underlying
concepts learned previously can be applied here too!

Why so? Both guys are hard workers, but while Bob advances faster and knows more
syntax and tricks, Alice is much better prepared for novelty. Bob gone in
breadth covering much of shallow waters and Alice dived in depth, one at a time. 
It's a choice if to recognize every new function and situation as unique and
standing alone, or to attempt generalizing and categorizing. Well, general
ideas, solutions and concepts are not always good and appropriate. Almost each
case of optimization and customization requires specific approach. Latest CPU
instructions are adopted, bits are squeezed, and
[graphical co-processor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units)
involved. But for covering more ground there's no other way then standard things
coming in well defined categories.

Take the same unit test libraries. In almost each modern framework, you'll find
suites, tests and asserts allowing to check equality, compare numbers and
arrays. Just reading the previous sentence won't make one an expert. Concepts
and ideas require time to understand. The first time you write test you
probably won't recognize the idea. It will take dozens of them, and probably
two or three different frameworks probably in a couple of languages to reveal
the pattern. Text books can speed you up, but without experience and search for
solutions to real problems, you won't come to deep understanding. It is pretty
fast to start copying code samples and even juggling with them a little.
Nevertheless it
[takes 10 long years to teach yourself programming](http://norvig.com/21-days.html).

My first source control system was Subversion. No, sorry, my first source
control system was copy-paste and manual backups to
[diskettes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk). I was first introduced to
Subversion much later and after some demonstrations and explanations got used to
it. Then later the company moved to Mercurial and the change came quite simple.
Well, there's difference between the client-server, where each commit goes
directly to the center, and the distributed system where you commit locally and
sync later. But it's not so large and doesn't interfere with most daily tasks.
Now, I work with Git at GitHub and again, the basic transition was moderately
fast and easy. I still tend to disagree with the conclusion from
["Mercurial vs Git; itâ€™s all in the branches"](https://felipec.wordpress.com/2011/01/16/mercurial-vs-git-its-all-in-the-branches/)
- Mercurial feels better adjusted for simple needs and Git feels stronger, more
powerful and harder to understand. However the general concepts of working
directory, commits, merges and sync - are the same. Yes, advanced tasks require
thorough understanding of specific details. But such occasions are less
frequent.

Look at any aspect of Computer Engineering: programming languages, libraries and
frameworks, tools, designs... It is a vast and rapidly evolving area, yet the
most basic ideas are few. You need to gain experience and deep understanding,
but once they are acquired, you will see the pattern and will recognize them.
All of a sudden C++ programmer starts reading Haskell and a JavaScript guru sees
sense in Lisp. Huge domain looks unapproachable to a fresh college graduate. In
2-3 years she might become bored by similarities everywhere. Given, she goes in
depth and tries to learn and understand how things work and why they become
as they are.

Another problem arises: here and now we should choose a GUI toolkit. Wikipedia
happily provides
[a couple of dozens of them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_widget_toolkits).
Which one is the best? Again, after some experience in such choices, it's clear
that the question needs clarification. Do we want something general or
dedicated, what is the operational system and intended language, are we seeking
anything popular or ... And so on. Finally, dozens easily shrinks to a smaller
number and then, after all foreseeable requirements are met, any of remaining
toolkits will do and it doesn't really matter whatever you chose. Probably, it
won't be perfect, but, since it fits all the demands, it will be good enough.
After you gain some experience with this tool, you'll probably understand better
if you like it or not and for what reason. And then other contestants can be
reviewed and evaluated against that reason. The important lesson is: you haven't
learn all the toolkits to take and make use of one. You should feel where to
stop.

By the way, same idea applies to learning. Not everything should be taken in one
gigantic gulp. Some trait can be left aside. In learning there's a good enough
point after which it would be best to pursue with bringing value and developing
a feature. Let's say a novice C++ programmer sees:

    ifstream input("text.txt");
    string str(
        (istreambuf_iterator<char>(input)),
        istreambuf_iterator<char>()
    );

It might be relatively simply to grok that in both statements a constructor
function is called. But what is iterator, is there any meaning to the
parenthesis in which the argument is enclosed, what it does and how does it
work? Some questions might and can be answered pretty fast. Other are less
obvious and probably should wait for another lesson. And this is OK. The
understanding should also be good enough, not perfect. Don't rush to become a
master in one day.

So this is the Developaralysis treatment - learn the things you do in depth and
seek for a good point to stop. Neither advice is simple, both takes much time
and consideration. Your career is in your hands. It's up to you to decide if to
feel overwhelmed or to invest the time and come to few roots.
