Today I've read an article
[You Too May Be A Victim Of Developaralysis](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/18/you-too-may-be-a-victim-of-developaralysis/).
The text caused me to think about some usual and established things in a new
light. With the evidence of beyond ten thousands likes and tweets, many others
might have shared my impression. After some consideration I decided that no,
I'm not a victim. I feel good with a wealth of existing languages, libraries,
frameworks and systems. I do pursue new ideas and techniques but I'm not harmed
by incompetence in all of them or even the best of them.

Probably, if you are a victim, there's a treatment for developaralysis. As with
most modern undertakings, let's start with Wikipedia:

> People with the flu are advised to get plenty of rest, drink plenty of
> liquids, avoid using alcohol and tobacco and, if necessary, take medications
> such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve the fever and muscle aches
> associated with the flu.

-- from <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza#Treatment>.

Humor aside. With profession, nothing comes as easy as cure to flu. And if all
you want is to take a rest and paracetamol, then better forget about software.
The real treatment is really simple to write, but very difficult to apply. It
is:

* learn in depth than in breadth
* respect good enough solutions

**TODO**:

* read a computer language is really simple; learn a new - not much harder
* this is because of a limited number of concepts, principles that are same
* optimizations, ideas come once and again under different names and wrappers
* but if you understand them deeply, you'll see the same core
* Microsoft released a new true platform once 2 years: COM, COM+, ActiveX, .NET,
WinForms, WPF, WinRT - but should you keep up with all of them?
* our current project is in Web - we learn environment on the way at a good
progress
* npm, bower - all other package managers, are not new under the sun; Unix had
rmp for dozens of years, nuget, etc - are essentially the same: they bring order
into packages and track their dependencies
* no need to learn everything; once you learned in depth you will understand the
good and the bad fast enough and you may stop at the first appropriate good
station

Take a developer experienced with Java that
by bad chance must start working in C\#. Oh crap! He was used to write
`System.out.println("hi")` but now he learns `Console.WriteLine("hi")`. And the
old good looping `for (String s : arr)` becomes unclear `foreach (var s in arr)`.
And he even didn't really start to harness standard libraries. And yes, good
programmers write tests first so we should go and learn `nUnit` after nice and
simple `jUnit` that he is accustomed to. Dummy `Assert.AreEqual(1+2, 3)` instead
of normal and clear `assertEquals("1+2=3", 1+2, 3)`.

By now you might be laughing to yourself, or calling this rubbish. So I'll
continue to my point. Yes, I brought those examples to show, that essentially,
both C\# and Java are not so intrinsically different. They are two languages
both in their own rights, with mostly not intersecting communities. But still
for one coming from Java it'll not take the same to be effective in C\# as for
those coming from no background at all. Or will it? Alice - sorry for bringing
security names here - is an good learner. When she first met unit tests in her
life, she was astonished, and started learning and experimenting what this is
about. And she quickly understood that there are a couple of well known players
in that field: suites, tests, asserts. Probably later she got to "system under
test", starting up and tearing down procedures. Bob is quite different. He's
renowned sprinter, accomplishing first most tasks. He quickly and efficiently
searches the Internet, copies and adapts relevant code parts, uses libraries
and finds well-hidden functions that boost his productivity. He don't stop to
contemplate over how things are done, what is the theory. He looks at examples
and quickly learns that in most of them there are suites, tests and asserts and
when the need arises, he comes to start up and tear down things.

Both Alice and Bob now should start again with a new language or a new unit test
library. How they perceive the change? Bob continues on the same pace with old
proven techniques. Look up in Internet, copy from documentation. He feels sorry
for all time spent previously and blames his bad luck on the change in course.
To Alice a miracle happens. After short time making herself accustomed to new
code samples she knows how to continue. And that she does at almost the same
pace as it was before. Yes, she still stops from time to time to debug a strange
mystery. And behavior is not exactly the same. But... all the underlying
concepts learned previously can be applied here too!

Why so? Both guys are hard workers, but while Bob advances faster and knows more
syntax and tricks, Alice is much better prepared for novelty. Bob gone in
breadth covering much of shallow waters and Alice dived in depth, one at a time. 
It's a choice if to recognize every new function and situation as unique and
standing alone, or to attempt generalizing and categorizing. Well, general
ideas, solutions and concepts are not always good and appropriate. Almost each
case of optimization and customization requires specific approach. Latest CPU
instructions are adopted, bits are squeezed, and
[graphical co-processor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units)
involved. But for covering more ground there's no other way then standard things
coming in well defined categories.

Take the same unit test libraries. In almost each modern one, you'll find
suites, tests and asserts allowing to check equality, compare numbers and
arrays. Just reading the previous sentence won't make one an expert. Concepts
and ideas require time to understand. The first time you write test you
probably won't recognize the idea. It will take dozens of them, and probably
two or three different frameworks probably in a couple of languages to reveal
the pattern. Text books can speed you up, but without experience and search for
solutions to real problems, it won't help to real deep understanding. It is
pretty fast to start copying code samples and even juggling with them a little.
Nevertheless it
[takes 10 long years to teach yourself programming](http://norvig.com/21-days.html).

My first source control system was Subversion. No, sorry, my first source
control system was copy-paste and manual backups to
[diskettes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk). I was first introduced to
Subversion and after some demonstrations and explanations got to it. Then later
the company moved to Mercurial and it was quite simple. Well, there's difference
between client-server where each commit goes directly to the center and the
distributed system where you commit locally and sync later. But it's not so
large and doesn't interfere with most daily tasks. Now, I work with Git at
GitHub and again, the basic transition happened pretty fast. I still tend to
disagree with conclusion from
[Mercurial vs Git; itâ€™s all in the branches](https://felipec.wordpress.com/2011/01/16/mercurial-vs-git-its-all-in-the-branches/)
- Mercurial feels better adjusted for simple needs and Git feels stronger, more
powerful and harder to understand. But again, the general concepts of
working directory, commits, merges and sync - are the same. Yes, advanced tasks
require thorough understanding of specific details. But such occasions are less
frequent then simple ones.

Look at any aspect of Computer Engineering: programming languages, libraries and
frameworks, tools, designs... It is a vast and rapidly evolving area, but the
most basic ideas are few. You need to gain experience and deep understanding,
but once they are acquired, you will see the pattern and will recognize them.
All of a sudden C++ programmer starts reading Haskell and JavaScript guru sees
sense in Lisp. Huge domain looks unapproachable to a fresh college graduate. And
in 2-3 years she might become bored by similarities everywhere. Given, she goes
in depth and tries to learn and understand how things work and why they become
as they are.
