Today I've read an article
[You Too May Be A Victim Of Developaralysis](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/18/you-too-may-be-a-victim-of-developaralysis/).
The text caused me to think about some usual and established things in a new
light. With the evidence of beyond ten thousands likes and tweets, many others
might have shared my impression. After some consideration I decided that no,
I'm not a victim. I feel good with a wealth of existing languages, libraries,
frameworks and systems. I do pursue new ideas and techniques but I'm not harmed
by incompetence in all of them or even the best of them.

Probably, if you are a victim, there's a treatment for developaralysis. As with
most modern undertakings, let's start with Wikipedia:

> People with the flu are advised to get plenty of rest, drink plenty of
> liquids, avoid using alcohol and tobacco and, if necessary, take medications
> such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve the fever and muscle aches
> associated with the flu.

Humor aside. With profession, nothing comes as easy as cure to flu. And if all
you want is to take a rest and paracetamol, then better forget about software.
The real treatment is really simple to write, but very difficult to apply. It
is:

* learn in depth than in breadth
* respect good enough solutions

**TODO**:

* read a computer language is really simple; learn a new - not much harder
* this is because of a limited number of concepts, principles that are same
* optimizations, ideas come once and again under different names and wrappers
* but if you understand them deeply, you'll see the same core
* Microsoft released a new true platform once 2 years: COM, COM+, ActiveX, .NET,
WinForms, WPF, WinRT - but should you keep up with all of them?
* our current project is in Web - we learn environment on the way at a good
progress
* npm, bower - all other package managers, are not new under the sun; Unix had
rmp for dozens of years, nuget, etc - are essentially the same: they bring order
into packages and track their dependencies
* no need to learn everything; once you learned in depth you will understand the
good and the bad fast enough and you may stop at the first appropriate good
station
